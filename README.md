JourneyTeller is an interactive tool where users construct their travel stories as a map. The map medium allows users to create a streamlined, informative, and engaging travel narrative to share with friends and family. In the application, users create trips and store places in it. Each place stores user-entered information such as notes, a photo, and geographic data (via Google Places API). Once places are added, a dynamic map is generated with all of the trip's places as markers on the map. Viewers of the map can learn about the user's travels by clicking on the markers for more information. They can also view a collage view of the pictures from the trip.
